# About
InvasiveSpecies is an action 1 versus 1 networked online game where 2 farmers compete to have the least amount of plants in their plot. You dig plants out of your plot to buy yourself time, and water your competitors plants to bring them closer to defeat.

Made in Godot 4.1 as part of GMTK Game Jam 2023
